  <h1>Take Control Of The Game</h1>
  <p>Beginning October 1st 2015, we are organizing a global initiative that involves all of the Clash of Clans players.  For 5-full days we are asking that all players of the game put their Townhouse's outside of the walls, and away from your defenses.  The goal here is to make it easy for everyone in the game to snipe townhouses for trophies, and bonuses.  If we can get everyone to participate, there's a really good chance that we can boost our walls to extermely high levels, possibly even max'ing them out without buying a single gem.</p>
  <p>We know this might sound crazy and far-fetched, but the reality is that once you hit the Master League, your attack bonuses start adding up.  You can literally cook up 200 barbs, and attack 20+ townhouses with a single army (using around 10-barbs per townhouse).  If you are in Master's league or higher, that adds up to over 2-million gold and elix, for every army you cook!</p>
  <p>We're not trying to hurt the Game, in fact, we love playing the game.  However, we also don't think it's fair that max walls take over a year or two to achieve without either gemming or barching all day, everyday.</p>

  <h2>Why Walls?</h2>
  <p>You can use your gold/elix/de on whatever you want.  Just keep in mind that most items take days/weeks to upgrade.  We suggest that you keep at least one builder available at all times, so you can keep upgrading your walls, which are instant, during our big event.</p>
  
  <h2>Why Only 5-days</h2>
  <p>Like we said, we're not looking to hurt the game. And if everyone has max-walls, then what fun is that.  So after our 5-day event, we hope everyone will go back to their normal routines.</p>
